# Quake Core
---
Quake Core is a mod to Quake 4 which implements mechanics from Fromsoftware's Armored Core series. It revamps standard Quake 4 controls by putting the player inside an SMC walker from the get go.

The SMC walker's movement capabilities have been significantly upgraded, with the ability to jump, dash, and fly.

The player will be able to fit their SMC walker with 10 unique weapons and 10 unique parts in order to customize it to whatever fits their needs.

Here are the instructions to install and play Quake Core:

## Installation
---
This repository provides a zip file with all the necessary DLLs and pak files to run this mod. Start by downloading that and unzipping it, then move the extracted `quakecore` folder into your Quake 4 directory.

If you have Quake 4 on Steam for example you would move `quakecore` into the directory
`C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Quake 4`

Now you are ready to play the mod

## Playing the Mod
---
Quake 4 has built in mod awareness, so if you installed the mod correctly, once you open the game and click the `Mods` button at the bottom left corner of the screen, the resulting pop up should show `quakecore` as one of the mods you can launch, launch that mod and you're set. I've provided an in game help screen to run down the basics of the mod.

### Creating a Shortcut
You can set Quake 4 to automatically launch your mod in one of two ways:

1. **(Steam Users Only)** On the game page for Quake 4 in your library, click the Settings button (all the way to the right of the PLAY button), then click properties. Scroll down to "Launch Options" and type `+set fs_game quakecore`. This will let you open the mod automatically through Steam.
   
2. Create a shortcut to the Quake 4 executable on windows, open the properties of the shortcut, then at the end of the "Target" field append `+set fs_game quakecore`. This will create a shortcut for you to launch the executable with the mod. (NOTE: If you have a copy of Quake 4 on Steam you may need to launch it unmodded through Steam first before launching the mod, as Quake 4 may ask you for a CD Key)
